# SmartSacco AI Agent

## What
- An AI agent/LLM that predicts whether a member of a given SACCO is likely to default on a loan based on previous loan history, credit score, and investment amounts.

## How to run SmartSacco
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- A TiDB Cloud Starter cluster: Create a free cluster here: [tidbcloud.comâœ¨](tidbcloud.com) 

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mikitoxo/Smartsacco1.git
   cd Smartsacco1
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies
```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Use this on Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Configure environment variables (create .env from .env.example with your TiDB credentials):
   If you are using TiDB Cloud, you can find the connection parameters in the [TiDB Cloud console](https://tidbcloud.com/).
   ```bash
      cat > .env <<EOF
   TIDB_HOST={gateway-region}.prod.aws.tidbcloud.com
   TIDB_PORT=4000
   TIDB_USERNAME={prefix}.root
   TIDB_PASSWORD={password}
   TIDB_DATABASE=pytidb_fulltext_demo
   EOF
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
5. Open [(http://localhost:8501)](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.


## How it works
-Input: User logs in and submits member_id of the Sacco member and amount they want to borrow.
-Search: Queries TiDB Serverless for member data.
-LLM Analysis: Mistral 7B evaluates eligibility.
-Output: Based on the member data, the AI agent predicts whether or not the member is eligible for the loan, it also states why they are/are not eligible.
